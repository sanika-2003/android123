It's my demo files.
Android is a mobile.
operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets
Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. 
It was unveiled in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, being launched in September 2008.

Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki.
You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles.
A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.
